                <h2>Hello, I'm Marie Almasy!</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Sunshine And More! I'm a self-taught polymer clay artist based in Michigan. 
                    My love for creating unique, handmade items began as a hobby and quickly grew into a passion for sharing my art with the world.

				<h3> My Artistic Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    It all started with a simple set of clay tools and a desire to express myself. Over the years, I've honed my skills and developed a style that blends 
                    whimsy and sophistication. From delicate earrings to intricate bookmarks, every piece tells a story and is made with love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not working on my next collection, I love exploring nature for inspiration, spending time with my family, 
                    and connecting with fellow artists and art lovers like you.
